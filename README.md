# Java Backend

This is my first approach to Java Backend, implementing Spring Boot

## The project

I did the project with a Platzi course, in which we deployed an API that represents a market. This has a connection to a Postgres database.

###Â Connection data

We also tested Spring Security, so in order to enter the API you must enter the credentials. User: "rodrigo" Password: "platzi"
